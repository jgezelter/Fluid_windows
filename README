Data_Processor.Rmd can act as a one-stop-shop for converting UV-Vis and FTIR data to single all-encompassing files, 
plotting the resultant data, and publishing the data in new forms
The file is structured into fluid processing and film processing. 
Each of these sections is then divided into data addtition, data processing, and plotting
Data addition just converts new data to more readable formats
Data processing generally does transformations to the data to get things like absorptance and add in metadata from google sheets
Plotting plots the data in helpful ways and saves plots to a file just outside of this R project folder

FTIR_reader.R only includes one function, it only acts to grab information from the nicolet is50 IR spectrometer and its accompanying application's .CSV files, it creates files with three columns: the filepath, wavelength in nm, and the relative intensity reading. Filepath will be constant for each file read

read_uv_vis_is.R only includes one function, it works to rearrange the two-row data structure outputted by the Cary 7000 UMS. May work on UMA data and not just IS data, check for

Deprecated contains some old code bases, including an old UV-Vis reading script, please do not use this one. Films_Plot_creator and Fluids_Plot_creator have been superseded by Data_Processor. scratch_markdown includes some scratchwork for figuring out how to best make functions and one-time plots, creating a similar markdown file can be good for debugging or for any inconsistent/intentionally messy work.
